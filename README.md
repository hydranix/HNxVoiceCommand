# HNxVoiceCommand
My voice command utility for Windows

This was my first program.

# How to use
Once built, you should be able to just launch it.

Add phrases with the add button, then say "computer", then the command.

When a command is detected, the program you chose with the command is executed.

Requires SAPI 5.4, which can be downloaded from Microsoft if not already present.
